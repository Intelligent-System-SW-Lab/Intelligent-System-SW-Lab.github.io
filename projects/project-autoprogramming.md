In this research, we will research on intelligent automatic programming techniques for web application, and we will development an user-friendly authoring and management platform based on intelligent automatic programming.

Project repository [https://github.com/iSysLab/sketch2html](https://github.com/iSysLab/sketch2html)

Major topics and techniques for our research are as follows.

## (1) A development of UI automatic generation technique based on object recognition of sketch-based images
- Technique for intelligent object recognition of sketch-based images
- Mapping technique among web objects and objects of sketch-based images
- Icon pack automatic generating technique for supporting template features
- Automatic CSS generation technique for template-based UI(User Interface)

## (2) A development of web service modeling technique based on drag and drop mechanism
- Data model design for web services
- Layout/style model design
- Database model design for web services
- Design and implementation of a tool data and control flow of web services
- Design and implementation of web service flow modeling tool for front-ends and back-ends

## (3) A development of automatic code generation technique for web services based on web service models
- Database automatic generation technique based on web service flow model
- Automatic PSM technique based on web service flow model
- Automatic code generation technique (Javascript, CSS, JSP, PHP, etc) based PSM
