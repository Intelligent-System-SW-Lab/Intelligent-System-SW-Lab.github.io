title: "Research on the efficient node re-deployment for robotic sensor networks in an unknown area"
---

Robotic sensor networks is a combination of robots and sensor networks. 
This study is for exploration of unknown areas using robotic sensor networks by relocating nodes.
We study the node relocating method by single robot, relocating method by multi robots.
Also, we will implement a simulator and a prototype robot.
